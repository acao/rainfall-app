  description: `The Larson-Miller parameter is a means of predicting the
                lifetime of material vs. time and temperature using a correlative approach
                based on the Arrhenius rate equation. The value of the parameter is usually
                expressed as LMP=T(C + log t) where C is a material specific constant often
                approximated as 20, t is the time in hours and T is the temperature in Kelvin.`,
